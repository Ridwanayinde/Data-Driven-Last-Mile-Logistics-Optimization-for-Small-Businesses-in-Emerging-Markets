# 🎓 MIT Emerging Talent Graduation Project

## Overview

This domain study is developed independently as part of my MIT Emerging Talent graduation project. It consolidates all foundational work I have done so far — including background review, brainstorming sessions (divergent and convergent), key terms, and the problem statement — providing a structured understanding of the Nigerian logistics ecosystem.

🧠✨ This is a personal research space that reflects my own exploration, analysis, and progressive refinement of the logistics sector.

## Purpose of This Domain Study 🎯

The purpose of this domain study is to:

- Document my **current understanding** of Nigeria’s logistics landscape.

- Capture my **iterative thinking process**, from background knowledge to  brainstorming to problem refinement.

- Provide a **structured reference** for subsequent technical work (data collection, modelling, or solution design).

## What This Domain Study Includes 📦

Below are the main components I have developed so far:

### 1. Background Review 📚

   A comprehensive overview of the Nigerian logistics industry, including economic relevance, market characteristics, and sector behaviour.

### 2. Brainstorming Sessions 💡

- **Divergent brainstorming:** Expanding possible ideas, identifying challenges, forces, constraints, and opportunities.  
- **Convergent brainstorming:** Narrowing down focus areas, grouping insights, and refining the core logistics issues.

### 3. Problem Statement 🚨

During my experience selling consumer goods as a small business owner in Nigeria, I observed that there was consistent
interest and repeat demand for my product, yet reaching customers reliably was extremely difficult without depending
on supermarkets or informal delivery channels. Supermarkets often rejected my product due to limited shelf space
and low brand recognition, while customers who wanted to buy directly could only be served if I physically
transported the product myself.

Even when demand grew—particularly within the student community—fulfilling orders required significant personal
effort, time, and mobility, and I frequently lost sales opportunities because I could not deliver when customers
needed the product. Attempts to sell beyond my immediate region were also limited, as formal logistics providers
charged fees that were too high for small quantities, while informal transport options were unreliable,
unpredictable, and sometimes exploitative.

This experience revealed a broader challenge faced by many Nigerian SMEs: despite having willing buyers, they
struggle to access affordable, reliable, and efficient last-mile delivery options that enable direct-to-consumer
sales. As a result, small businesses face reduced profitability, constrained market reach, and dependence
on intermediaries—even when demand exists.

### 4. Summary of Understanding

The challenge of last-mile delivery for Nigerian SMEs exists within an interconnected logistics system involving
producers, customers, formal couriers, informal transporters, digital platforms, and retail intermediaries.
Small businesses often operate with low shipment volumes, limited storage, minimal brand visibility, and narrow
operating margins, making them especially sensitive to delivery cost, reliability, and speed.

Within the current system:

- **SMEs depend on intermediaries** (such as supermarkets) for visibility and access to buyers.
- **Customers prefer convenience and immediacy**, especially in urban and campus environments.
- **Formal logistics providers price services in ways that disadvantage low-volume shipments**, making nationwide consumer delivery economically impractical.
- **Informal delivery networks fill the gap**, but introduce risk, inconsistency, lack of tracking, and trust issues.
- **Demand signals exist**, but are fragmented, hyperlocal, and data-poor.
- **Logistics infrastructure varies significantly across regions**, affecting accessibility and cost.
- **Digital commerce channels exist**, but do not guarantee fulfillment capability.

A systems view suggests that inefficiencies emerge not from lack of demand, but from misalignment between
SME scale, delivery economics, trust mechanisms, and logistical capacity. Potential leverage points include
demand clustering, route optimization, micro-distribution hubs, data visibility, trust and rating systems,
and affordable micro-parcel delivery models.

### 5. Actionable Research Question

How can data be used to identify the factors that affect the affordability and reliability of last-mile delivery
for small businesses selling directly to consumers in Nigeria?

### 6. Key Terms & Concepts 📝

   Standardised definitions of all logistics-related terminology used throughout the study, ensuring clarity and consistent interpretation.

### 7. Market & Sector Mapping 🗺️

- Stakeholder maps, value chains, sub-sector breakdowns, and structure of the Nigerian logistics ecosystem (to be expanded).

### 8. Data Sources & References 🔗

- A list of verified external sources used during the research.

## How to Use This README 🧭

This README serves as the guide for anyone exploring or contributing to the domain study. Since this is a solo project, all work reflects my own research and decisions. Use this file to:

- Navigate the domain study components

- Understand the rationale behind each section

- Stay aligned with the overall logistics project direction

This README will continue to evolve as I add:

- Sector analysis documents

- Visual diagrams (stakeholder maps, value chains, etc.)

- Data dictionaries

- Methodology notes
