# 💡 Divergent and Convergent Thinking

## Overview 🌍

Divergent and convergent thinking are essential strategies for problem-solving and domain study:

Divergent thinking: Explore a wide range of possibilities without judgment.

Convergent thinking: Narrow down options to the most relevant, feasible, and actionable ideas.

In this project, these approaches help analyze the Nigerian logistics sector and frame the research question effectively.

## ⚡ Divergent Thinking

During divergent thinking, we aim to **generate as many ideas and observations as possible:**

- Identify **stakeholders:** SMEs, customers, transport unions, logistics companies, government agencies

- Explore **challenges:** high costs, infrastructure gaps, port congestion, limited technology adoption

- Brainstorm **opportunities:** route optimization, micro-distribution hubs, data analytics, digital tracking

- Use **mind-maps or brainstorming sessions** to capture ideas freely

## 🎯 Convergent Thinking

After idea generation, convergent thinking is applied to focus and prioritize:

- Highlight **critical bottlenecks** that are solvable within project constraints

- Identify **high-impact opportunities** for last-mile delivery improvements
- Formulate **actionable research questions**

- Focus on **solutions that are feasible, scalable, and data-driven**

## 🚀 Application to Milestone 1

- **Divergent phase:** Gathered insights on Nigerian logistics sector challenges and SME delivery constraints

- **Convergent phase:** Summarized key findings in the Summary of Understanding and refined the research question

- Ensures research is comprehensive yet focused, bridging sector-level analysis and SME-specific challenges.

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Balancing divergent and convergent thinking supports a holistic understanding of the problem domain

- Enables a smooth transition from general sector research to specific SME-focused problem framing

- Provides a foundation for data-driven solutions in last-mile logistics optimization
